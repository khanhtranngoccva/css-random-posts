# CSS Single Div Random Posts

## Abstract

- This repo stores random images and posts from Twatter including my own images, that I rebuilt in CSS using a homemade
  generator script.
- Only 1 div will appear in each output image - no canvas element, no clip-path, (virtually) no JS except for JS pre-built by the script for the purpose of handling autoplay restrictions.
- These regenerated files will not appear on CodePen as they are both incredibly space-intensive and require minimal effort to create.

## Implementation details
- Generated CSS images are made using <a href="https://github.com/khanhtranngoccva/one-div-generator">one-div-generator</a>.
